# OpenCanary scripts
Set of scripts for static analysis of source code and build results.

Main focus is on C++ in an visual studio 2013+ environment however the priceples used should apply to any environment.

Goals:
- improve source code by upholding/guarding a standard that the user can set 
- provide an incremental approach to allow improvement of large existing code bases over time

Priciples:
- incremental approach
- provide insight into the current state of source code compared to the chosen standard into the kinds of possible improvements
- provide short list of todos (short of a 'top 10' of next work items)

Its one thing to point out oppertunites for improvement, but when dealing with a large existing code base, it it is easy to be overwhelmed by issues and difficult to know where to start
